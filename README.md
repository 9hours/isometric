HTML5 Canvas Isometric Engine
=========


This repo contains a very old (and poorly coded) basic engine used to develop: http://walking.beakable.com, used in the following paper http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/cis/research/publications/papers/strath_cis_publication_2595.pdf.

The engine is currently in a pretty poor syntax state however I do plan to tidy it up and get it back to being as feature rich as an earlier (and even messier) project, Glacial Flame: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlsipfu5Qq4.
