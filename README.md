HTML5 Canvas Isometric Engine
=========

![JSiso](http://jsiso.com/jsiso.png)


This repo contains an MIT Licensed Isometric HTML5 tile engine Copyright Â© 2013 of Iain Hamilton and Edward Smyth.

The most current running dev build can be viewed here: http://isometric.beakable.com/

For a list of examples and further details checkout: http://jsiso.com

Currently contained features are:
  - AMD structured using requireJS 
  - Unlimited layer stacking
  - Heightmaps
  - Auto scaling of image dimensions
  - Zooming (not 100% perfect yet)
  - Rotating (not 100% perfect yet - Rotates whole map but doesn't readjust view)
  - Simple Collision
  - AI Pathfinding using Web Workers
  - Custom built Particle Engine
  - Easy fake lighting
  - Player vision limiting
  - Simple player device interaction
  - Easy Node Multiplayer Integration
  - Basic support for Standard non Isometric tiles



Setup Instructions:

1: In each of the samples you'll see something like: ```<script data-main="../js/jsiso.js" src="../js/require.js"></script>```. These two paths will need to be correct in order for JsIso to work.

2: Throughout the samples it makes use of a PHP script (XMLFiles.php) to read a directory and output a XML list of image files``` XML.loadXML('../XMLFiles.php?folder=/ground/');```. This path will also need to be correct or you will need to pass an array of image paths manually through to the image loader ```imgLoader.loadImageArray(XML.getContent('files','file'), true);```.

3: That should be everything.


Particles

Pathfinding (All cuboids apart from blue are AI)
Pathfinding calculations are handled via webworkers.
