HTML5 Canvas Isometric Engine
=========


This repo contains a very basic Isometric HTML5 tile engine.

An early and very basic was implementation used to develop:
http://walking.beakable.com, used in the following paper:
http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/cis/research/publications/papers/strath_cis_publication_2595.pdf.

The engine is currently in early stages however it's planned to be as feature rich as an earlier (and very messy sytnax wise) project, Glacial Flame: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlsipfu5Qq4.
